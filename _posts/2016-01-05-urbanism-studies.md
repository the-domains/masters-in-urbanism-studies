professionals regarding the importance and value of the public realm in 
the design of our cities.

# **Program outline**

The rationale behind Urbanism Studies is 
for professionals to understand and work in interdisciplinary design and
planning teams, coupled with the growing desire for cities to establish
different, new forms of urban living. As the goal of this programme is 
to move design thinking from objects to places, our core Urban Studios 
differ from traditional studios in several ways.

Our approach 
involves in-depth explorations of urban design issues by combining five 
topic-based modules situated within the three studio courses. Ongoing 
seminar reading series and urban film studies are included in the 
studios. The integrated final project builds upon the previous three 
studios, leading to a thesis portfolio that reflects the main 
achievements and thinking of each student as an outcome and product of 
their intense, focused learning throughout the year.

Furthermore, 
students are offered the opportunity to collaborate with some of the 
leading Built Environment (Urbanism) programmes in the world: ETH 
Zürich, CED at UC Berkeley, UCL Bartlett in London and Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. This affords students fantastic
global collaborative opportunities on a wide range of real world cases.
Urbanism Studies is externally supported and financed by Ax:son Johnson
Foundation, as well as by KTH -- Royal Institute of Technology.
