<h1><b>Program outline</b></h1><p>The rationale behind Urbanism Studies is 
for professionals to understand and work in interdisciplinary design and
 planning teams, coupled with the growing desire for cities to establish
 different, new forms of urban living. As the goal of this programme is 
to move design thinking from objects to places, our core Urban Studios 
differ from traditional studios in several ways.</p><p>Our approach 
involves in-depth explorations of urban design issues by combining five 
topic-based modules situated within the three studio courses. Ongoing 
seminar reading series and urban film studies are included in the 
studios. The integrated final project builds upon the previous three 
studios, leading to a thesis portfolio that reflects the main 
achievements and thinking of each student as an outcome and product of 
their intense, focused learning throughout the year.</p><p>Furthermore, 
students are offered the opportunity to collaborate with some of the 
leading Built Environment (Urbanism) programmes in the world: ETH 
Zürich, CED at UC Berkeley, UCL Bartlett in London and Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. This affords students fantastic
 global collaborative opportunities on a wide range of real world cases.
 Urbanism Studies is externally supported and financed by Ax:son Johnson
 Foundation, as well as by KTH – Royal Institute of Technology.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9dbb0dfc-cbb0-47cb-80ac-d174882efb01.jpg"><h1><b>Course overview, Urbanism Studies</b></h1><p>The programme consists of two semesters (terms) or four periods of 
studio and (module) course work. The final thesis project is integrated 
with ongoing seminar reading series and urban film studies.</p><h1>Fall Semester</h1><p>First semester of studies starts with the 
Nordic perspective in Studios work combined with the big picture on 
urban challenges and transformations on different scales and levels. The
 studio work continues with the advanced urban design studio in Sweden 
and Europe as well as a module extending knowledge in history and theory
 of urban form. The year ends up with extended training and in 
contemporary tools and techniques used for advanced public life studies.
 All courses are mandatory</p><p>Study Period 1: September 1 – October 31</p><ul><li>Studio 1: AG2186 Nordic Studio – Designing Urban Public Places 7.5 credits</li><li>Module 1 – AG2135 Challenges for Metropolitan Urban Regions 7.5 credits</li></ul><p>Study Period 2: November 3 – January 19</p><ul><li>Studio 2: AG2187 Advanced Urbanism Studio – Urban Spaces of the City -  6 credits</li><li>Module 2 – AG2182 Histories and Contemporary Theories of Urban Form - Fundamentals of Urbanism 6 credits</li><li>Module 3 – AG2183 Public Life Studies and Tools for Urban Analysis 3 credits</li></ul><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f5c241f2-2bca-420c-bead-d994bea0c360.JPG" alt="" title=""><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a5abfe1-74bf-4846-9813-0a5bafb92357.jpg"><h1>Spring Semester</h1><p>The second semester starts with a mandatory 
International Design Studio worldwide where designing a new public realm
 is the focus. This is combined with modules on urban sociology and 
environmental psychology as well as a higher seminar course where 
complex issues of the public realm will be discusses. The last period of
 the second semester, finally, consists of individual master degree 
thesis project. All courses are mandatory with the possibility to take 
one elective course in the last term.</p><p>Study Period 3: January 20 – March 20</p><ul><li>Studio 3:  AG2188 International Placemaking Studio – Rethinking the Public Realm 6 credits</li><li>Module 4 – AG2184 New Urban Sociology and Environmental Psychology for Urban Design 6 credits</li><li>Module 5 – AG2185 Higher Seminar in Public Places and Urban Spaces Studies 3 credits</li></ul><p>Study Period 4: March 23 – June 9 </p><ul><li>Studio 4:  AG218X – Degree Project in Urban Studies, Advanced Level, 15 credits</li></ul><p>Reading
 Urbanisms Colloquium and Urban Film Series are fully integrated into 
the program studios and course modules. The final master’s thesis 
project work Studio (AG218X - Degree Project in Urban Studies, Advanced 
Level, 15 credits) is a unique composite project work synthesizing all 
of the results of previous course work into a final product that 
students can utilize as a complete portfolio of their studies in 
urbanism at KTH.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a9cb1f2-57b2-480d-8933-8b7d700d3793.jpg"><h1><b>Degree project</b></h1><p>The Capstone Project is the final Master’s 
thesis project. This is a unique composite work synthesising all of the 
results of previous studio and module course works into a final product 
that students can utilise as a portfolio of their one-year studies at 
KTH. This is a “living book” of accumulated knowledge from the beginning
 that will act as an advanced postgraduate theoretical, strategic and 
design portfolio. The thesis project also includes methodologies in 
urban design research, public life studies and researching the city, 
plus a research seminar focused on thesis preparation.</p><h1><b>Career prospects</b></h1><p>The
 prospects on the labour market for graduates from the programme are 
exceptional. Employers can be found in the public sector, municipal, 
regional, national as well as in the private sector (architects, 
residential, construction and consulting) where graduates receive 
design, planning, formative, coordinating, investigating and acting 
competition tasks. Our graduates can expect to go to work for planning 
and design consultancies; city agencies; business and development 
groups; regional planning agencies; state planning agencies; private 
developers; non-profit community and affordable housing developers and 
within academia.</p><h1><b>Scholarships</b></h1><p>Aside from             <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/kth/urbanism-studies/fees-funding">KTH's regular scholarships</a>, the Master’s Programme in Urbanism Studies offers four KTH scholarships, sponsored by the Ax:son Johnson Foundation.</p><h1><b>General admission requirements</b></h1><p>The             <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/kth/admission">general admission requirements</a> are the same for all programmes.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/02a0cfc4-c098-4c53-b0a0-9d6830974acd.jpg"><h1><b>Application and deadlines</b></h1><p>Application code: E0139</p><p><a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/kth/urbanism-studies/how-to-apply-1.68487">More information on the application process and deadlines.</a></p><picture>
